# Bomberman-clone

We have made a clone of the 1983 game Bomberman in Godot 4, for the Robotics and Science Fair 2024 in Munkemose. 

There are a few things that are not 100 % perfect and there are mechanics and features that are missing in this game. However, we have decided sharing our files because, when we started working on this project, we could not find any guides or templates for us to work from. So therefore, here you guys have a starting point, if you ever wanted to recreate the game! 

If you decide to download it, please take a look at: https://w1setown.itch.io/bombermonke
